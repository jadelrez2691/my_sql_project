# Building a database from Scratch and Writing Queries to Organize wareheouse
This project had two major parts:
 1) Data Wrangling 
2) Creating database using MySQL 
 - Normalize  the  dataset.   Identify  and  list  the  tables  that  should  be  created,  the  types  ofcolumns for each table, as well as the primary and foreign keys of each table.
 - Once  the  information  is  stored  in  the  database,  create  a  MySQL  query  (using  SQL)  thatwill create a dataset with the columns "metric name", "year", and "metric value", where theunit of analysis is "metric - year" (one row uniquely identifies a permutation of a financialmetric and the year, such as "Revenue - 2011")
 - Suppose you wanted to prepare a dataset, based on this one, for visualization.  The visualwill have the year on the x-axis and percentage change of the aggregated metric found inthe previous problem on the y-axis.  Here we will only care about operating income andcost of goods sold. Create a query that will return a dataset that will allow us to create the
 - Questions 1 and 2 should be put into MySQL. Export the database to a "Self Contained File(.sql)" and submit this .sql file. In addition, create an ERM Diagram for your database. Thiscan be accomplished as we discussed in class (Go to Database>Reverse Engineer to createone in MySQL Workbench). Copy the diagram and paste into Word.
 - When you completed everything, save the word file as a PDF and submit this
